# 3-bit SAR-Type ADC with Arduino Control

This project implements a 3-bit SAR-type analog-to-digital converter using discrete components.  
The conversion logic is handled via binary search by an Arduino microcontroller.

### Highlights:
- Sample-and-hold circuit, resistor ladder, differential comparator
- Real-time waveform digitization of a 1 kHz sine wave
- LTSpice simulations, breadboard implementation, Arduino + Python code
- Achieved 85% quantization accuracy on 96 samples
